# FastAPI Demo

This demo is currently only runnable with a custom build of Wrangler. This
will no longer be necessary once the 02-23 release of workkerd is out and
integrated. 

Here's how to run it: 
```
$ npx https://prerelease-registry.devprod.cloudflare.dev/workers-sdk/runs/8024147674/npm-package-wrangler-5015 dev
```
